# Chameleon- An Adaptive Chatbot
# Individual Project for University of Warwick Third Year
Conversations are essential for personal well-being and to form meaningful connections with others. While there are a myriad of benefits into having a meaningful conversation, many individuals find themselves without the opportunity of having conversational partners for effective communication or having a safe space to convey private knowledge.
Lacking communication skills or conversational partners often leads to difficulties in maintaining relationships and having effective communication, contributing to feelings of loneliness and depression.
Given that negative experiences, social anxiety, and insecurity are often cited as significant contributors, being able to have conversations can be instrumental in supporting individuals with their mental health and confidence to mitigate the impacts of these contributing factors.

With the advancement of smart conversational agents in recent years, resulting in a surge in demand for this cutting-edge technology for a diverse range of users, including those seeking for a conversational partner.
While current chatbots excel at responding user queries at high speed and accuracy, they often fall short of acting as conversational partners due to their configuration, which is to serve as helpful assistants rather than attentive listeners. 

In an attempt to address the problem, Chameleon intends to utilise the benefits of self-talk and self-compassion to provide a comfortable environment for users to engage in a conversation and disclose their thoughts in.
As chatbots become increasingly prevalent in our society, this project aims to leverage this technology by developing an adaptive chatbot capable of emulating the user's conversational demeanour and mirroring their personality traits, allowing a conversational experience akin to talking to oneself.
